Introduction
---------------------//
This is my first React Native application.  I have enjoyed diving into the world of React mobile dev, and am excited to continue learning.  For this project, I focused primarily on React Native and Redux, though I have identified a number of ancillary tools (Node.js, Babel) that merit further study.


ACCOMPLISHMENTS
---------------------//
Problem Statement:
Users don't like going to dealerships to buy cars.  It's just too much hassle!

Solution:
Created a simple app where users can browse cars, optionally filter by Make, Model, and Year, and enter into a purchase flow.

- Leveraged EXPO as a boilerplate project to get started
- Integrated Redux
- Abstracted styles in a global styles location
- Placed Data service methods into it's own class
- Mocked an API response with cars.json data provided in Services directory
- Implemented simple navigation with StackNavigator
- Built a few custom components for rendering list items


NEXT STEPS
----------------------//
Integrate with a node back end.
Set up a complete build process like Gradle with the following
- ESLint
- CSS preprocessor like SASS?
- Unit Test Framework 
- I18n localization library
Dive deeper in to Snowflake and related tools
Design and build more features!


LIMITATIONS
----------------------//
I did my work on an older MacBook Air.  This laptop is too old to upgrade to latest OSX and XCode.  While I also don't own an iPhone or iPad, I was limited to doing dev on my android phone.  Presumably the resulting app will be the same on an IOS device. (fingers crossed)
